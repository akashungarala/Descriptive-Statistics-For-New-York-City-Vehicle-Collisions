# Descriptive Statistics for New York City Vehicle Collisions

In RStudio, we tried to analyze and visualize the data set of New York City vehicle collisions (2012-2015). Cleaned the data by using RDSTK library to get the address based on the latitude and longitude coordinates. Data analysis and visualization has been done based on the contributing factors for accidents like number of accidents across boroughs yearly, annual trends in accidents in each boroughs, number of accidents at a particular time, number of injuries and deaths over the years, most common reasons for the accidents, areas in a particular borough having most accidents.
